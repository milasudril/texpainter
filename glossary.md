# Glossary

This pages summarizes different concepts used in Texpainter.

## Image

An image is a matrix of pixels. Its purpose in Texpainter is sort of similar to a "layer" in a more
conventional image processing application like GIMP, Krita, or Adobe® PhotoShop®, but since
Texpainter uses a graph instead of a stack for compositing, they are not really layers.

## Palette

A palette consists of 16 colors. The main purpose of a palette is to help to create a "consistent"
image. This means that you typically select some colors and shades of these, and use these colors
for all drawing operations. Palettes can also be utilized from within the compositor as a colormap.
