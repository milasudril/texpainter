# Quick-start guide

To create a texture, you first need to create a new document. You can do this by clicking
"Create a new document" in the <a href="../app/startup_menu.html">startup menu</a>. You will also
find the option in the "Document" menu. This will bring up a dialog box that allows you to specify
the canvas size. The canvas is basically the domain where the final render will be drawn. You will
find more information about size specification in the documentation for the
<a href="../app/size_input.html">size input widget</a>.
