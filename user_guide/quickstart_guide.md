# Quick-start guide

To create a texture, create a new document. You can do this by clicking "Create a new document" in
the <a href="../app/startup_menu.html">startup menu</a>. You will also find the option in the
"Document" menu.

This will bring up a dialog box that allows you to specify the canvas size. The canvas is basically
the domain where the final render will be drawn.
